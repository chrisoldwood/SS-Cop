SS-Cop v0.1
===========

Introduction
------------

SS-Cop is a simple database schema analysis tool that casts its eye over your
tables, procedures and functions to tell you if you've violated your project's
naming conventions, missed a primary key, etc. 

The inspiration comes from FxCop which is a free static code analysis tool from
Microsoft for .Net. I've long been a fan of static code analysis tools although
they are usually way outside the budget of the non-professional developer.

Installation
------------

None required, this archive contains only source files. You do need to have
SQLCMD on your path to run the packaged build script.

Documentation
-------------

There is a HelpFile folder with an HTML based manual in it.
