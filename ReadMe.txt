SQL Server Cop v0.1
===================

Introduction
------------

SQL Server Cop is a simple database schema analysis tool that casts its eye over
your tables, procedures and functions to tell you if you've violated your
project's naming conventions, missed a primary key, etc. 

The inspiration comes from FxCop which is a free static code analysis tool from
Microsoft for .Net. I've long been a fan of static code analysis tools although
they are usually way outside the budget of the non-professional developer.

Releases
--------

Stable releases are formally packaged and made available from my SQL tools page:
http://www.chrisoldwood.com/sql.htm

The latest code is available from my GitHub repo:
https://github.com/chrisoldwood/SS-Cop

Installation
------------

None required, this archive contains only source files. You do need to have
SQLCMD on your path to run the packaged build script.

Documentation
-------------

In the stable release package there is a HelpFile folder containing an HTML
based manual. There is also an online version of the manual available here:
http://www.chrisoldwood.com/wip/ss-cop/manual/SS-Cop.html

Doxygen based documentation (generated with my sql2doxygen script) for the
framework API is available here:

Development
